# Brief Explanation of the Data

As an alternative to the currently available "maximum bidding", Facebook just launched a new bidding option called "average bidding".

One of our clients made the decision to test this new functionality and run an A/B test to see if average bidding results in more conversions than maximum bidding. 

Since the A/B test has been running for a month, and our client is now anticipating our analysis of the test's outcomes. The key success factor for them is "Purchase."

Statistics testing should therefore concentrate on the Purchase metric.
